The youth_share_pop.csv is the data we will be using for this exercise
The data comes from the ACS 2019 5 year estimates and has the youth share column which is: total youth/total population

```{r read exercise data}
data <- read_csv("youth_share_pop.csv")
```

Add a column that has the youth share of population in a %
i.e. multiple youth_sharep by 100

(uncomment and run code below)
```{r}
# data <- data %>%
#   mutate(youth_share_pc = (youth_sharep*100))
```

#write csv for data
```{r}
#write.csv(data, "yth_share_pc.csv")
```
